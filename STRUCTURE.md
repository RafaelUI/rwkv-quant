## Design principles

**`calibration/` never imports from `backends/`.** It's the part that
actually answers "which bits, which channels stay exact" — pure PyTorch,
runs identically on a laptop or a CUDA box. This is deliberate: the
finding that motivated this repo (sensitivity doesn't transfer across
model scale) means calibration has to be re-run per checkpoint, so it
needs to be fast and portable, not tied to whichever backend you're
targeting.

**`formats/` is a first-class module, not a detail inside `backends/`.**
The RWKV ecosystem doesn't currently have a shared quantized-checkpoint
format (unlike GGUF for llama.cpp) — `rwkv_quant`'s `.rwkvq` format is
meant to be backend-independent so a checkpoint quantized on a Mac can be
served from a CUDA box without re-running calibration.

**`models/rwkv7_ref.py` is explicitly not a production inference path.**
It's a from-scratch PyTorch port used only so calibration/ablation can
run without depending on any backend. It's slow on purpose (O(T) python
loop, matches the reference math exactly) — correctness over speed,
because calibration results feed directly into the quantization decisions
shipped to backends.

**`backends/` are the only platform-specific code.** `metal/` wraps
[rwkv-metal](https://github.com/)'s kernels; `cuda/` is a separate
implementation. Both are expected to consume the same `.rwkvq` files
produced by `calibration/` + `formats/writer.py` — no backend-specific
calibration logic.

**Two entry points, one underlying config type.** `api.py`'s `quantize()`
accepts either a `preset` string (`"medium"` / `"strong"`, defined in
`presets.py`) for quick start, or an explicit `QuantConfig` for full
control. Both paths end up as the same `QuantConfig` object consumed by
`calibration/fake_quant.py` — presets are just pre-filled configs, not a
separate code path.
